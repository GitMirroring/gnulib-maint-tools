This directory contains unit tests for gnulib-tool.

Before using it, set the environment variables
  - GNULIB_SRCDIR     - points to the directory that contains gnulib-tool
  - GNULIB_TOOL_IMPL  - determines the implementation of gnulib-tool.
and make sure that you have
  autoconf 2.72
  automake 1.16.5
in your PATH.

The directory gnulib-data contains a particular version of gnulib, namely
commit 35245921a8f0eace93bef05814525673078b58c7 from the stable-202401 branch,
*without* the gnulib-tool program.

The tests themselves are shell scripts named 'test-*.sh' (which makes it
easy to run a single test), in one of the these directories:
  - info-tests        Tests invocations which only produce output on stdout.
  - import-tests      Tests invocations which add files to a given package.
  - create-tests      Tests invocations which create a directory.

Each of the directories also has a 'test-all.sh' script, that runs all
the enabled tests in that directory.
